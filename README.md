Miscellaneous utilities for Bioinformatics and NGS data analysis.

#### Description
This repository contains a set of utilities to solve common small tasks encountered in Bioinformatics research. A brief description of each program is reported here:<br/>

- `calc3FirstRRBS.pl`: Quality control on MspI digestion efficiency for RRBS experiments.<br/>
- `checkmerge.py`: Merge sequencing of the same libraries coming from different Illumina runs.<br/>
- `countFastqReads.pl`: Count reads in FASTQ file.<br/>
- `extract_gencode_tss.sh`: Extract TSS frome GENCODE annotation GTF file. <br/>
- `features-from-gtf.pl`: Retrieves genomic coordinates for TSS, exons and introns from GTF annotation file. <br/>
- `gtf2bed.sh`: Convert file from GTF to BED format.<br/>
- `mutfilter.py`: Filter BAM by specific mutation.<br/>
- `samToBam.sh`: Convert file from SAM to BAM format.<br/>
- `summarize_demultiplex.pl`: Summarize demultiplexing of Illumina sequencing run.<br/>
- `demultiplex-undetermined-v3.py`: Demultiplex Undetermined FastQ from Illumina sequencing run.<br/>
